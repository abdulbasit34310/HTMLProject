<tr>
<th>TYPES</th>
<th>DESCRIPTION</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Soil pollution</td>
<td>Also known as Land Pollution, this occurs due to incorporation of unwanted chemicals in the soil due to human activities. Use of insecticides and pesticides absorbs the nitrogen compounds from the soil making it unfit for plants to derive nutrition from. Release of industrial waste, mining and deforestation also exploits the soil. Since plants cannot grow properly, they cannot hold the soil and this leads to soil erosion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Noise pollution</td>
<td>It is caused when a noise which is of higher intensity than 85 db reaches our bare ears. It may lead to psychological problems like stress & hypertension. It can also lead to permanent hearing impairment, which is worse. It is mainly caused by loud pumps and compressors in the chemical industries. Even marriage functions and rock music concerts are often ignored contributors to this type of pollution.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Radioactive pollution</td>
<td>This is considered one of the most dangerous pollution because of its permanent effects. An unarrested upset in a nuclear plant , careless nuclear waste disposal, etc. It can cause cancer of skin, blood, infertility due to exposure, birth defects and blindness; It has the ability to permanently change soil, air and water are the major sources of life. It can even cause mutation in species which can propagate for ages.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Thermal/heat pollution</td>
<td>This is caused as a result of excessive heat release in the environment. This leads to irreversible and undesirable changes of almost permanent nature. Industries and Vehicles are direct contributors to this. Deforestation is an indirect contributor.Other than the greenhouse gases,zyada this has increased the earth's temperature, and has potential to cause drastic climatic changes; and wildlife extinction.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Water Pollution</td>
<td>Every living being depends, directly, on water so this has taken a heavy toll on the entire living population. Other than direct dependencies, more than 60% of the species live in some form of water. Thus water pollution is another major type of pollution that needs to be curbed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Light pollution</td>
<td>Whenever illumination available is more than what's required in an area, this pollution kicks in. It is more noticeable in big cities, on advertising boards and billboards, mainly during large scale events, vis-a-vis Concerts, sport events & even mariiages, at the night. It mainly affects the astronomical observations by making the stars very difficult to observe & study.</td>

<dd>World Environment Day (WED) is celebrated on the <span style="color:blue;"> 5th of June</span> every year, and is the United Nation's principal vehicle for encouraging awareness and action for the protection of our environment. First held in 1974, it has been a flagship campaign for raising awareness on emerging environmental issues from marine pollution, human overpopulation, and global warming, to sustainable consumption and wildlife crime. WED has grown to become a global platform for public outreach, with participation from over 143 countries annually. Each year, WED has a new theme that major corporations, NGOs, communities, governments and celebrities worldwide adopt to advocate environmental causes.</dd>
